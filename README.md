# Explainabel_AI_Predictive_Maintainance
This repository contains the code used in a video series demonstrating explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods applied to predictive maintenance. The video series covers the following topics:

## Table of Contents

1. Logistic Regression and Decision Tree Interpretability
2. Permutation Feature Importance
3. SHAP Values
4. LIME
5. Gradient-Based Methods

The code is organized into separate folders for each topic, with each folder containing a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the XAI method on a particular dataset. Additionally, each notebook contains detailed explanations and comments to help understand the code and the underlying concepts.



### Logistic Regression and Decision Tree Interpretability
In this section, we explore the interpretability of logistic regression and decision tree models applied to Tennessee Eastman process data. We will discuss various techniques that can help us understand how these models make predictions.

### Permutation Feature Importance
In this section, we will cover permutation feature importance, a method for determining the importance of features in a machine learning model. We will discuss how permutation feature importance works and demonstrate how to implement it on a sample dataset.

### SHAPLY Values
This section will cover SHAPLY values, a method for interpreting machine learning models. We will discuss how SHAPLY values can help us understand the contribution of each feature to a model's output.

### LIME
This section will explore LIME, a method for interpreting machine learning models. We will discuss how LIME works and demonstrate how to use it to interpret a sample model.

### Gradient-Based Methods
In this section, we will cover gradient-based methods, a set of techniques that use the gradients of a model's output to interpret its predictions. We will discuss different types of gradient-based methods and provide examples of how they can be applied to different types of models.
